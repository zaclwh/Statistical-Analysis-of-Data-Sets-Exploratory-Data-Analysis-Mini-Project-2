Project objectives

Business Objective: Increase YoY revenue from game purchases by increasing retention rate of gamer

Analytics Objective
Test CEO's hypothesis to analyze if moving the first gate from level 30 to 40 increases retention rate and number of game rounds played

1. Detect and resolve problems in the data (Missing value, Outliers, Unexpected value, etc.)

2. Plot summary statistics and identify trends to answer basis business questions
  i. What is the overall 7-day retention rate of the game?
  ii. How many players never played the game after installing?
  iii. Does the number of users decrease as the level progresses highlighting the difficulty of the game

3. Generate cross tab for two player groups to understand the difference in the 1-day and 7-days retention rate & total number of game rounds played [20-30 mins] 

4. Perform two-sample test for groups A and B to test statistical significance amongst the groups in the sum of game rounds played i.e., if groups A and B are statistically different
  i. Check the assumptions of two sample test
    a. Normal distribution - Apply Shapiro test
    b. Homogeneity of variance â€“ Apply Levene's Test
  ii. Apply the relevant two sample significance test method based on the results from test for normality and homogeneity

5. Based on significance testing results, if groups A and B are statistically different, which level has more advantage in terms of player retention?
